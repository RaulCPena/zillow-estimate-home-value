# Estimate Home Value

#### Background:

- email containing information on each properties location was lost by Zach :anger:
	- property taxes are assessed at the county level and we would like to know what states and counties the properties are located in
- we want to know the distribution of tax rates for each county. What should the data look like :question:
	- The data should have the following:
		- __tax__ amounts and __tax__ values of the home
		- include in report the distribution of tax rates for each county, which will show how much each property varies by county and the rates of the bulk of the properties which are around each property

#### Other notes:
- Our first model will use the following features:
	- square feet of the home
	- number of bedrooms
	- number of bathrooms
	- __taxvalueddollarcnt__ We can expand further after we create a __MVP__(minimally viable product)
#### The process:
- ensure all requirements given by __stakeholders__ are being met and represented in our data, report, and model
- ensure that __QA__(quality assurance) data validation is being done, for example: make sure the data is what we think it is
